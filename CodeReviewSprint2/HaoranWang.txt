Sprint 2

File being reviewed: Mario.cs
Author of the .cs file: Bin Chen

Specific comments on code quality: 
The code quality is pretty good. This file implement the states and actions of mario and also implement the state transitions when colliding with different objects 
in different directions. The situations that mario colliding with coins and starman are not implemented, which will be implement in the future sprints. When Implementing 
OnCollide, the code seems to be quite complicated, there are multiple if-else statements inside of an if-else statement, which could be use switches to substitute or 
implement the entire OnCollide as a class.


Time used: 15 minutes

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A potential change related to this file would be to implement the OnCollide method in a collision class, since in the future other objects will also need to implement for
collisions.
