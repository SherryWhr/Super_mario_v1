Specific comments on code quality:
this class is an abstract class all other object classes. I think the Boundry properity is very good since it makes checking AABB collision easier. The DrawBoarderRectangle
can also be a great method to draw the boundary of different objects in different color. However, the four collide direction detect method seems so complecated to understand, 
and seems have some bugs on checking the direction.

Hypothetical change:
Using alternative methods to check the direction of collision or fix the current method
