File being reviewed: 
QuestionBlock.cs, PyramidBlock.cs, UsedBlock.cs, HiddenBlock.cs,
FloorBlock.cs, BrickBlock.cs

Specific comments on code quality: 
All these methods are used for creating block objects and all block objects cannot change location.
Therefore, in the future, it can be considered to add a Block class for drawing sprites, updating, 
and generating objects. The exisitng block related classes can inherit Block class and develop their
specific tasks or functions in it.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:
If there are more kinds of blocks added into the game, then make all blocks just inheriting BaseCollideObject
is not wise. Such implementation will cause errors and make the code not organized.
