each method in this class has reasonable length and serve only single purpose
fields that cannot be accessed from outer class are private
the coupling of this 38 which is a little high
Cyclomatic Complexity is 44, middle level difficulty to test
the Draw Method should be refactorted to be more simplified
The state machine part in this class is fine, 
but the transition states should be reconsidered, like how to implement Star state without 
rewrite all other state methods

hypothetical changes:
Actually there many refactory work to do for this class.
Refactor this class to be easy implement physics. 
Or extent a BasePhysics class
Also should keep lower the coupling
