Specific comments on code quality:
The way of implementing the Update() and Draw() methods are good, and the implementation of Explode() is creative. However, there are too much useless variables in this class, 
and the sheetSize variable passing to the constructor may be useless since this varible is largely dependent to the spritesheet where the 
spritesheet is initialized in the constructor, so I think this variable should also be initialized in constructor.
