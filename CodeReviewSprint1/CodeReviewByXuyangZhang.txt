All methods are in reasonable length and for single purpose. 
Only field that should not be accessed outside class were labeled as private.
Include a prototype of state machine,which is convenient for future design
There some unused fields which serves for future features
The current coupling is 12 which is not too high. 
Cyclomatic complexity is 4 so it is not hard to test in current stage
It is unnecessary to extend itemSprite as a middle layer in the inheritance tree
the Sprite class h=has already contained draw
The constructor used now is not for the purpose of of collision detection, so it can be reused for next sprints

Time to complete: 10min

hypothetical changes:
delete Itemsprites and override Draw methods
change position type to Rectangle in the Sprite class and rebuild constructors for each sprite classes, This is time consuming
