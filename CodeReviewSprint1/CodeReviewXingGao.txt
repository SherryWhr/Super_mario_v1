Sprint 1

File being reviewed: 
    OneUpMushroom.cs, SuperMushroom.cs
Author of the .cs file: 
    Haoran Wang	
Specific comments on code quality:
    The code is well organized and neat. Thought there are not a lot of comments used in this file, the author applied 
    meaningful variable names to make her code readable. It is wise to use upCount and downCount to limit the moving height 
    of the mushroom. The constructor function only requires two parameters - game and position, which makes the code flexible
    and easier for extension later.
Time used: 
    12 minutes
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could 
or could not easily support that change:
    In the later sprint, if the team would prefer to add features to mushrooms, such as let the mushroom "fly" and explode, 
    the programer only needs to add new function to support this change. Hence, the current version is appropriate for future
    update.
   

File being reviewed: 
    ItemSprite.cs
Author of the .cs file: 
    Xuyang Zhang
Specific comments on code quality:
   The code is short but comprehensive. The inheritance between ItemSprite and its parent and child classes are appropriatlly set.
   The weakness is that since all item classes have the common part of their constructor functions, it might be better if an
   abstract constructor can be declared in the ItemSprite.cs. This will increase the readability and flexibility of the code. 
Time used: 
    6 minutes
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could 
or could not easily support that change:
    In the future work, if the team would add more items into this game, with the assist of inheritance, the new feature will be 
    easily implemented and include two functions - update and draw.
