Specific comments on code quality:
CollideOnRight() and CollideOnRight() methods are too complicated, include many check of classes. The idea of creating CollideMario() class is good, since it 
avoids duplicated codes. The Collision resoponses logic is a little messy.

Maybe refactor the CollideOnRight() and CollideOnRight() methods
