Sprint Number:
Sprint 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
BrickBlock.cs

Author of the Class: Xuyang Zhang

Time Used: 10 min

Comments on Code Quality:

Basically. each method in this class has reasonable length and serve only single purpose
fields that cannot be accessed from outer class are private
the coupling of this class is 30, I think it is in the reasonable range
Cyclomatic Complexity is 21, middle level difficulty to test
It is good to use a state machine and state pattern for the brick,
which kind of decouple the states from brick entity class
and the transition functions in this class avoid bunch of if-else statements, making the code more easy to read;

Further improvement
for the bump function in this class; maybe think about to extract the mario states judging part
and put it in the brick state's transition to do this job
