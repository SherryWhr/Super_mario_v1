This class is very long with more than 300 lines. And according to the Code Metrics, its cyclomatic 
complexity is 73 and its coupling is 39. 
The Mario constructor is well written, this dictionary of the states makes the code tidier and 
easier to read since is used state pattern. 
The UpdateSprite method is much easier compared to last time, since it combines the two states as 
instance. 
The Collide methods are not that well written, since all the 4 case of collision directions consider
colliding with the same game objects using if else statement. This part gives the code high cyclomatic 
complexity. This also happen in other objects' collision methods, for exameple, OneUpMushroom and 
Starman.

Hypothetical changes:
The collision for the four directions could be potentially combined together after deliberate
consideraing. Collision from four directions for all the objects could be made into one class too, 
since they have very similar structure.
