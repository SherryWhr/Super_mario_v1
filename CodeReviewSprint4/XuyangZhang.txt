Comments on Code Quality:
State Pattern is used for Game States. It implements an abstract basestate class in this file.
Each concrete state class extend the base class. The transition functions' using virtual keyword in the base class 
reduce repeated code in the concrete classes, which decrease code smells. Also, the transition functions make it possible to 
avoid bunch of else-if statement. So, the code are clear to read and easy to maintain.

Further improvement:
Place the BaseClass part in another file.
