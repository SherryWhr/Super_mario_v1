Comments on Code Quality:
Singleton is used in this sprite factory. Each method in this class has reasonable length and 
serve only single purpose. 
It has two private dictionaries of sprite and collision size which cannot be accessed from outer 
class.
The coupling of this class is 30, medium level of coupling. Cyclomatic Complexity is 39, medium 
level of difficulty.
These two value shows that the factory is quite complicate. This is because there are quite a lot 
of if-else statements in the Helper method and BuildMario method, in which we used these method 
to compose the names to get access to the sprites.

Further improvement
We could potentially refactor the Helper method and BuildMario. We could either make them into 
smaller method, or find a way to combine them into one method, since they use the same way to 
compose the sprite name.
