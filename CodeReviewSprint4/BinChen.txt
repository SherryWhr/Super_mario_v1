Specific comments on code quality:
The idea to create a new spiteBatch to draw the black screen is interesting, the setting of delay is good. 
However, magic number still exists in this class. Also, the CK1 and CK2 variables are read from const instead of the map definition 
file, which I think might cause hugh problems when changing map definition.

Number of minutes taken to complete the review:
10 minutes

Hypothetical change:
Putting all of the magic numbers into Const.cs, getting the checking points from map definition instead of from const.cs
