Sprint 4

File being reviewed: 
FontFactory.cs, TextSprite.cs, HUD.cs

Author of the .cs file: Xuyang Zhang, Haoran Wang

Specific comments on code quality: 
FontFactory, HUD and TextSprite were designed to display information such as Player, Coins Collected, Points, 
Current Level and Time Remaining. TextSprite class includes color, font, and other related fonts information can
provide more flexibility to the customized layout output. However, the HUD constructor may need to be refactored. 
For example, in the constructor, "MARIO = FontFactory.GetFont("MARIO");" can be added into a dictionary where MARIO
is the key word, and "new Vector2(Const.MAR_X, Const.MAR_Y)" is the value. Using proper data structure can simplify
the draw method.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation 
could or could not easily support that change:
If we would like to add more customized features into layout output by providing a user interface, the current structure 
does not support us to do that. This can be modified by changing the constructor of FontFactory(), which can parse the 
value of color, or other information.
